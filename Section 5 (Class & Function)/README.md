# Class & Function

## Class
Python is an object oriented programming language. Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.

```
# The simplest
class MyClass:
  x = 5
```

```
## There is a function
class Calc:
    def doubles(x):
        return x*2
    
    def square(x):
        return x*x
    
    def total(x,y):
        return x+y
```


## Function
A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

```
def square(x):
    return x*x

square(10)
```
