### DATA STRUCTURE
Data structures are a way of organizing and storing data so that they can be accessed and worked with efficiently. They define the relationship between the data, and the operations that can be performed on the data.

1. Tuple <br/>
is a collection which is **ordered** and **unchangeable**. Allows duplicate members. <br/>
x = ("a", "b", "c")
2. List <br/>
is a collection which is **ordered** and **changeable**. Allows duplicate members.<br/>
x = ["a", "b", "c"]
3. Dict <br/>
is a collection which is **unordered**, **changeable and indexed**. No duplicate members. <br/>
x = {
  "brand": "Fer",
  "loc": "Malang",
  "year": 2009
}
4. Set <br/>
is a collection which is **unordered** and **unindexed**. No duplicate members. <br/>
x = {"a", "b", "c"}

5. Array <br/>
is a sequential arrangement of data elements paired with the index of the data element. Only Array can do mathematical operation.

6. Dataframe <br/>
is two-dimensional size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns).
